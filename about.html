                    Greg Delain is an aspiring professional currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science
		    at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a strong foundation in computer skills
		    and customer service. I currently have an internship for the summer of 2025 at Schnieder
		    National working in information security. My hobbies include working out, playing video

                    My name is Jack Stecker, and I'm an Information Science major in the final semester of my 
                    senior year. I am driven, goal-oriented, and eager to leverage my background in customer 
                    service and my passion for helping others in a professional setting.
                    Some of my hobbies outside of school include going to the gym, cooking, listening to music, 
                    watching movies, and my favorite sports teams. I also love to be outdoors. Whether it's running,
                    hiking, fishing, hunting, or boating, I've always been infatuated with nature. I have some 
                    background in using HTML and CSS to create my own websites, so I am eager to better my 
                    understanding of those languages and develop the skills necessary for proficient web design.
